# AI Chat Assistant Setup & Usage Guide

## Overview
The Medication Inventory page now includes an **AI-powered chat assistant** that uses Google's Gemini API to understand natural language and automatically update your medication inventory.

## Features

### ü§ñ Natural Language Understanding
The assistant can understand phrases like:
- "I took my Lisinopril"
- "I missed my Metformin dose this morning"
- "I have 50 Aspirin pills left"
- "I just refilled my Atorvastatin"

### üì¶ Automatic Inventory Updates
Based on your chat messages, the assistant will:
- **Decrease inventory** when you take medication
- **Log missed doses** without changing inventory
- **Update counts** when you manually count pills
- **Process refills** and update refill counts

### üíæ Persistent Storage
- All medications saved to `localStorage`
- Chat history preserved between sessions
- API key securely stored locally
- Data persists across page refreshes

## Using the Chat Assistant

### Opening the Chat

2. Click the **Message** icon (üí¨) in the header
3. Chat sidebar opens on the right

### Example Conversations

#### Taking Medication
```
You: I just took my morning Lisinopril
Assistant: Great job taking your Lisinopril! I'll update your inventory. 
You're doing well with your medication adherence.
```
‚Üí **Result**: Inventory decreases by 1 pill

#### Missing a Dose
```
You: I forgot my Metformin this morning
Assistant: No worries, it happens! Try to take it as soon as you remember 
if it's not too close to your next dose. I've noted that you missed this dose.
```
‚Üí **Result**: Logged but inventory unchanged

#### Manual Count Update
```
You: I counted and I have 45 Aspirin pills
Assistant: Thanks for updating me! I've updated your Aspirin inventory to 
45 pills. That gives you about 45 days of supply.
```
‚Üí **Result**: Inventory set to 45 pills

#### Refill Request
```
You: I refilled my Atorvastatin today
Assistant: Excellent! I've processed your Atorvastatin refill. Added 30 
pills to your inventory. You now have 2 refills remaining.
```
‚Üí **Result**: Adds full bottle, decrements refills

## How It Works

### 1. Context-Aware Processing
The assistant receives:
- Your current medications list
- Dosage and frequency information
- Current pill counts
- Recent conversation history

### 2. Gemini AI Analysis
The AI:
- Understands natural language
- Identifies medication names
- Determines the action (took/missed/update/refill)
- Generates a friendly response

### 3. Automatic Updates
Based on the AI's analysis:
- Medication counts update in real-time
- Changes persist to localStorage
- Toast notifications confirm actions
- Page refreshes to show new counts

### 4. Data Flow
```
User Message ‚Üí Gemini API ‚Üí Parse Action ‚Üí Update Inventory ‚Üí Save to localStorage
     ‚Üì                                              ‚Üì
Chat History                                  Visual Update
```

## Local Storage Structure

### Medications
**Key**: `vital-wise-medications`
```json
[
  {
    "id": "1",
    "name": "Lisinopril",
    "dosage": "10mg",
    "frequency": 1,
    "currentCount": 15,
    "pillsPerBottle": 90,
    "refillsRemaining": 3,
    ...
  }
]
```

### Chat History
**Key**: `vital-wise-chat-history`
```json
[
  {
    "role": "user",
    "content": "I took my Lisinopril",
    "timestamp": "2025-10-16T14:30:00.000Z"
  },
  {
    "role": "assistant",
    "content": "Great job taking your Lisinopril!...",
    "timestamp": "2025-10-16T14:30:02.000Z"
  }
]
```

### API Key
**Key**: `vital-wise-gemini-key`
```
AIzaSy... (encrypted string)
```

## API Integration Details

### Gemini Client (`src/lib/gemini-client.ts`)

#### Key Functions

**`initializeGemini(apiKey: string)`**
- Initializes the Gemini client with your API key
- Call this once during app setup

**`getGeminiClient()`**
- Returns the initialized client
- Throws error if not initialized

**`chat(message, medications, history)`**
- Sends message to Gemini API
- Returns response and parsed action
- Handles context and conversation history

#### Action Types
```typescript
interface MedicationAction {
  medicationName: string;
  action: "took" | "missed" | "refill" | "update";
  amount?: number;
  note?: string;
}
```

### API Request Format
```json
{
  "contents": [{
    "parts": [{
      "text": "System prompt + context + user message"
    }]
  }],
  "generationConfig": {
    "temperature": 0.7,
    "topK": 40,
    "topP": 0.95,
    "maxOutputTokens": 1024
  }
}
```

### Response Parsing
The assistant looks for:
```
ACTION: {"medicationName": "Lisinopril", "action": "took", "amount": 1}
```

This JSON is:
1. Parsed from AI response
2. Removed from display text
3. Used to update inventory

### Chat Not Updating Inventory
**Check**:
1. Open browser console (F12)
2. Look for errors
3. Verify localStorage has data:
   ```javascript
   localStorage.getItem('vital-wise-medications')
   ```

### Clear All Data
To reset everything:
```javascript
// In browser console (F12)
localStorage.removeItem('vital-wise-medications');
localStorage.removeItem('vital-wise-chat-history');
localStorage.removeItem('vital-wise-gemini-key');
location.reload();
```
